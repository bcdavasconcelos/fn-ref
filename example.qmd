This extension offers the ability to cross-reference footnotes using markdown syntax. The markdown syntax is simple: add the anchor to the footnotes using `[]{#fn-label}` and then cite using `@fn-label`.[^1] See, for example, footnote @fn-label3.

```
See footnote @fn-label3; and then take a look at @fn-label2;
finally, @fn-label1 has great content.
```

See footnote @fn-label3; and then take a look at footnote @fn-label2;
finally, footnote @fn-label1 has great content.

\lipsum[1-8]

The only supported format is LaTeX/PDF, but HTML will also produce a link to the correct footnote without, however, using the correct label. This is a temporary solution until Pandoc supports cross-referencing footnotes in HTML.[^2]

\lipsum[1-8]

This next footnote will be right in the body of the text^[[]{#fn-label3} This is an inline pandoc markdown footnote.].


[^1]: []{#fn-label1} The footnote label should come at the begining.

[^2]: []{#fn-label2} Another splendid footnote, full of relevant content.
